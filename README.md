## Hi, I'm Yasir 👋

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at **INSA Lyon**, with a strong focus on algorithms, formal logic, and software development. Previously ranked as **top student** across three consecutive semesters at the University of Montpellier.

Currently exploring research-oriented development through internships at [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/), where I've worked on genomic data analysis pipelines and formal verification tools.

### What I'm working on

- Building reliable software with clean architecture and proven correctness
- Competitive programming (60th/800 at Match'Up)
- Contributing to algorithmic competitions as part of INSAlgo

### Tech Stack
Languages: Python, Java, OCaml, JavaScript, C/C++
Tools: Git, Linux, VSCode
Libraries: NumPy, matplotlib, CustomTkinter
Practices: Agile/Scrum, TDD, Formal Verification
```

**Regular use:** Git, Linux, matplotlib, NumPy, CustomTkinter  
**Methodologies:** Agile/Scrum, Test-Driven Development, Formal Methods

### Featured Projects

**[Genomic Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/yasiralgit/genomic-analysis-pipeline)**  
Python pipeline for k-mer based genomic analysis with GUI (CustomTkinter) and interactive visualizations. Achieved 40% performance optimization through algorithm improvements.

**[Logic Verification Tool](https://github.com/yasiralgit/logic-verification-tool)**  
OCaml tool for semantic web database consistency checking with formal correctness proofs. Autonomous project management from specification to validated delivery.

**[Competitive Programming Solutions](https://github.com/yasiralgit/competitive-programming)**  
Collection of optimized solutions for algorithmic competitions (SWERC, Match'Up). Focus on graphs, dynamic programming, and advanced data structures.
